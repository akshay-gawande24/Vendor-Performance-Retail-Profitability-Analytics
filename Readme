# Vendor Performance & Retail Profitability Analytics

## Overview

This project analyzes **vendor performance**, **retail profitability**, and **inventory efficiency** to generate actionable insights for purchasing, pricing, and stock optimization in a retail environment.

A complete **data analytics pipeline** was built using SQL for ETL, Python for analysis and hypothesis testing, and Power BI for interactive visualization.

---

## Business Problem

Retail businesses often struggle to:

- Identify underperforming brands that need pricing or promotional adjustments
- Understand which vendors truly contribute to profits
- Decide whether bulk purchasing reduces cost effectively
- Detect inventory turnover inefficiencies and dead stock
- Validate vendor profitability differences using statistical evidence

This project addresses these challenges using data-driven analysis.

---

## Dataset

Multiple CSV files located in the `/data/` folder:

- Sales data
- Vendor data
- Inventory data

These were integrated into a **summary analytical table** for further analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| SQL | ETL, joins, CTEs, summary tables |
| Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy) | EDA, visualization, hypothesis testing |
| Power BI | Interactive dashboards |
| GitHub | Version control and documentation |

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Removed transactions where:
  - Gross Profit ≤ 0
  - Profit Margin ≤ 0
  - Sales Quantity = 0
- Corrected data types and handled outliers
- Merged lookup tables
- Created vendor-level summary metrics

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Issues Identified

| Issue | Observation | Business Impact |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Negative Gross Profit | Min: -52,002.78 | Loss-making transactions |
| Infinite Profit Margins | Invalid cost values | Data inconsistency |
| Unsold Inventory | High stock value | Slow-moving items |

### Outliers

- Freight costs up to **257,000**
- Extremely high purchase and actual prices

### Correlation Insights

| Variables | Correlation | Insight |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Purchase Qty vs Sales Qty | **0.999** | Overstocking pattern |
| Purchase Price vs Profit | Weak | Price alone doesn’t drive profit |
| Sales Price vs Profit Margin | -0.179 | Higher price ≠ higher margin |

---

## Research Questions & Key Findings

### Brands Needing Promotion
- **198 brands** with low sales but high profit margins
- Ideal for marketing and promotional focus

### Vendor Dependency Risk
- Top 10 vendors contribute **65.69%** of total purchases
- Indicates over-reliance risk

### Bulk Purchasing Benefit
- **72% reduction** in per-unit cost in large orders

### Inventory Turnover Issue
- **$2.71M** worth of unsold inventory detected

### Vendor Profitability Comparison

| Vendor Category | Mean Profit Margin |
|------------------|-------------------|
| High-performing Vendors | 31.17% |
| Low-performing Vendors | 41.55% |

Lower-volume vendors had higher margins.

### Hypothesis Testing

Statistical testing confirmed a **significant difference** in profit margins between vendor groups, indicating different pricing and supply strategies.

## Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard visualizes:

- Vendor-wise sales and margins
- Inventory turnover
- Bulk purchase savings
- Performance heatmaps
- KPI-driven insights

1. Data ingestion from CSV files  
2. SQL-based ETL and summary table creation  
3. Python-based EDA and statistical testing  
4. Visualization in Power BI  
5. Documentation in GitHub

Vendor Performance & Retail Profitability Analytics

Overview
This project evaluates vendor performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization. A complete data pipeline was built using SQL for ETL, Python for analysis and hypothesis testing, and Power BI for visualization.

Business Problem
Effective inventory and sales management are critical in the retail sector. This project aims to:

- Identify underperforming brands needing pricing or promotional adjustments
- Determine vendor contributions to sales and profits
- Analyze the cost-benefit of bulk purchasing
- Investigate inventory turnover inefficiencies
- Statistically validate differences in vendor profitability

Dataset
- Multiple CSV files located in /data/ folder (sales, vendors, inventory)
- Summary table created from ingested data and used for analysis.

Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Common Table Expressions, Joins, Filtering)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Power BI (Interactive Visualizations)
- GitHub

Data Cleaning & Preparation
Removed transactions with:
   - Gross Profit ≤ 0
   - Profit Margin ≤ 0
   - Sales Quantity = 0
   - Created summary tables with vendor-level metrics
   - Converted data types, handled outliers, merged lookup tables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Negative or Zero Values Detected:
   - Gross Profit: Min -52,002.78 (loss-making sales)
   - Profit Margin: Min -∞ (sales at zero or below cost)
   - Unsold Inventory: Indicating slow-moving stock

Outliers Identified:
  - High Freight Costs (up to 257K)
  - Large Purchase/Actual Prices

Correlation Analysis:
  - Weak between Purchase Price & Profit
  - Strong between Purchase Qty & Sales Qty (0.999)
  - Negative between Profit Margin & Sales Price (-0.179)

Research Questions & Key Findings
 1. Brands for Promotions: 198 brands with low sales but high profit margins
 2. Top Vendors: Top 10 vendors = 65.69% of purchases → risk of over-reliance
 3. Bulk Purchasing Impact: 72% cost savings per unit in large orders
 4. Inventory Turnover: $2.71M worth of unsold inventory
 5. Vendor Profitability:
    - High Vendors: Mean Margin = 31.17%
    - Low Vendors: Mean Margin = 41.55%
 6. Hypothesis Testing: Statistically significant difference in profit margins → distinct vendor strategies

Dashboard
- Power BI Dashboard shows:
   - Vendor-wise Sales and Margins
   - Inventory Turnover
   - Bulk Purchase Savings
   - Performance Heatmaps
